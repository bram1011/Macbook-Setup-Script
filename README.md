# Macbook-Setup-Script
Made for my IT job. Makes incoming Macbook setups uniform by installing needed programs, creating a local admin user, and renaming the Macbook.

domain.sh is designed for desktops, only installs the needed programs

laptop.sh has full functionality

requires that the script is in the same directory as the "installers" folder, with all needed programs named the needed names:

cc.pkg
meraki.pkg
office.pkg
vpn.pkg
